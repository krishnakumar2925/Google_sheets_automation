# Google Sheets Test Automation Suite

This project automates functional test cases for **Google Sheets** using Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and the Google Sheets API. It is built to demonstrate automation capability around spreadsheet manipulation such as reading, writing, editing, and validating data.

## ‚úÖ Automated Test Cases (8/10 Implemented)

### Test Case 1: Verify spreadsheet can be created
- Verifies if a new spreadsheet can be created successfully by checking if the sheet URL is accessible and its title matches the expected value.

### Test Case 2: Verify spreadsheet can be renamed
- Confirms the ability to rename a spreadsheet by using the Google Sheets API to input text in a specific cell and verifying the updated name.

### Test Case 3: Verify data can be entered in a cell
- Validates the ability to enter data into a specific cell by overwriting existing content and verifying that the new data is correctly updated.

### Test Case 4: Verify data can be edited in a cell
- Tests the ability to edit data in a cell by clearing the content of a specified cell and confirming the updated value.

### Test Case 5: Verify data can be deleted from a cell
- Checks if data can be deleted from a specific cell by simulating appending a new row of data and confirming the update using the API.

### Test Case 6: Verify bold formatting on a cell
- Ensures that bold formatting can be applied to a cell, verifying that the bold style is correctly set through the Google Sheets API.

### Test Case 7: Verify cell background color can be changed
- Validates the ability to change the background color of a cell, entering data, refreshing the page, and checking for persistence of the updated background color.

### Test Case 8: Verify SUM formula
- Confirms that a SUM formula is correctly applied in the Google Sheets document, ensuring that the formula calculates the correct sum of specified cells.

## ‚ùå Not Yet Automated (Due to Time Constraints)

### Test Case 9: Verify import of large dataset
- Requires simulation of uploading or importing 1000+ records and validating correctness and performance.

### Test Case 10: Verify performance with large number of rows/columns
- Needed benchmarking read/write latency and UI behavior under high load. Skipped due to time limits.

### Remaining Testcases
- Refer: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qaAdFTbA6BoZxobzkMCagL563IAipdOlwpWPnLlyhFM/edit?usp=sharing

   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (if using Maven)
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Google Sheets API Setup**
   - Go to [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
   - Create a project and enable **Google Sheets API**
   - Download `client_secret.json` and place it in `src/main/java/.../utilities/`

4. **Run the test**
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

## üß© Limitations & Production Considerations

- **Automation Tool Limitations**:
  - Selenium cannot directly interact with Google Sheets UI elements reliably due to dynamic DOM and iframe restrictions.
  - Addressed by integrating Google Sheets API for reliable and scalable testing.

- **Non-Automated Scenarios**:
  - Large dataset handling is complex due to sheet UI lag and API rate limits. Such cases are better validated through batch API operations and performance assertions.
